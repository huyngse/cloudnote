# 🌤️ cloudnote

Welcome to **cloudnote** - the note-taking app with a name that’s a total lie.

Despite sounding like it lives in a server farm somewhere between Jupiter and your fridge, **cloudnote works 100% offline**. That’s right: no clouds, no accounts, no mysterious syncing - just your browser and your beautiful brain.

Think of it as a digital sticky note board powered by pure vibes and local storage magic.

## ✨ Features

🌼 **Create colorful notes**  
➕ Click the plus button to summon a new pastel note - like summoning a thought sprite with better handwriting.

📋 **Paste text & images**  
`Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` your way to glory. cloudnote turns whatever's on your clipboard (text or image) into a new note - instantly, like a magician with sticky fingers.

🖐️ **Drag & move**  
Rearrange your notes like fridge magnets of wisdom. Drag them around and pretend you're organizing your life.

↔️ **Resize**  
Pull the corner to resize your note. Make it large for Important Thoughts™ or tiny for secrets.

♻️ **Rotate**  
Click the rotate button and give your note a fresh new angle - for when you literally need to *look at things differently*.

🌿 **Decor mode**  
Double-click (or press the 🌿 button) to turn a note into a chill, non-editable decoration. Great for quotes, doodles, or reminders that “you got this”.

🔒 **Lock decor**  
Toggle the lock button to freeze your aesthetic masterpieces. No more accidental edits - just frozen perfection.

🗑️ **Delete**  
Click ✖️ to gracefully say goodbye to a note. It's not you, it's just... minimalism.

💾 **Local storage persistence**  
Everything lives right in your browser under the sacred key `cloudnote`. Notes stay snug and safe, even after a page refresh. It’s like the cloud, but smaller, cozier, and not spying on you.
